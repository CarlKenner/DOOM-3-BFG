To create an installer for Distibution on Windows:

 * Install NSIS on your computer.
 * Select FORCE_INTERNAL_ZLIB in CMake for gzdoom project (to eliminate dependency on zlib.dll)
 
 * Change version number in top level CMakeLists.txt
 * Build in Release mode (so vcredist_x86.exe libs will work)
 * Test:
     Does crosshair work in Rift mode?
     Do menus work in Rift mode?
     Does intermission screen work (well enough) in Rift mode?
     Does Rift mode work?
     Does green/cyan mode work?
 * Write release notes.
 * Update web page
 * Git commit locally
 * Rerun CMake
 * Create installer by building PACKAGE target.
 [* Copy installer to installer folder NO]
 * Create a release tag, like "GZ3Doom1.8.6_i"
 * Commit changes to github
 * Post download to site.
 * Post announcement on the web site and the usual forums.
 * Post a new demo video.
