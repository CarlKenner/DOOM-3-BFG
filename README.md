GZ3Doom is a 3D adaptation of the legendary first-person-shooter game Doom, which was first released in 1994.

GZ3Doom is based on gzdoom, and adds stereoscopic rendering, including Oculus Rift mode. 
Graf Zahl, the maintainer of GZDoom, moved the GZDoom source code to github in 2013 , making it easier
to add this feature to GZDoom. My contribution consists of a few days work. These other folks have spent 
decades enhancing Doom so that I would be able to do this.

gzdoom is in turn based on zdoom, and adds OpenGL rendering.

zdoom is based on Doom, the revolutionary computer game from the 1990s.

Torr Samaho helped to get GZ3Doom working with the Nvidia 3D vision system (on consumer-level video boards!).

Other improvements to GZ3Doom would not have been possible without the helpful feedback of many players, including Indecom, naitguolf, Lagahan/ShadowEater, Santimun, Hadstec, drash, LitteGuy, cool2000m, RandomGuy7, Zeberpal, skyrimguy, Nash, Trisk, and many others. Thanks everyone for the helpful feedback.

Skyjake and DaniJ, of the Doomsday project, helped create many other advances that I have back-ported into GZ3Doom.
